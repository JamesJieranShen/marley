I am pleased to announce that the first peer-reviewed journal article
presenting the MARLEY treatment of charged-current |ve| scattering
on |40Ar| was `published <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.103.044604>`__
this morning in Physical Review C.

The new paper provides a detailed description of the physics models for this
process as implemented in `MARLEY v1.2.0
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3905443>`__, the current stable release of the
code. Calculations of a variety of total and differential cross sections are
shown. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for supernova
neutrino energy reconstruction and prospects for future improvements to MARLEY.

Although this article is the first refereed publication focused on MARLEY
itself, results calculated using the code have been presented in several other
scientific papers. A growing list of these is available in the `bibliography
<../pubs.html>`__ section of this website.

A `companion paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11867>`__ documenting MARLEY's
implementation and usage was also recently submitted to `Computer Physics
Communications
<https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computer-physics-communications>`__ but is
still under review.

Many thanks to all who have supported this work over the last six years of
development!
